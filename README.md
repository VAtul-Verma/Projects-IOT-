This is repository for IOT based LPG Monitoring and leakage detection system
 This system would be
helpful to monitor the usage of LPG on a regular basis and to
alert about any hazards that may occur due to LPG leakage.

The proposed LPG monitoring and leakage detection system
comprises of two sensors, a microcontroller, an LCD display,
relay and a buzzer which is being powered by a power supply

Working : When it detects the Leakage of the LPG an alarm is triggered Which indicates that the gas is Leake. 

Flowchart of LPG leakage detection.
